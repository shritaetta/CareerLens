# CareerLens 🎯

An AI-powered internship recommendation and career tools platform that helps students find the best-fit internships, build ATS-optimized resumes, and evaluate their application strength.

---

## Features

- **Smart Recommendations** — Semantic ML-based internship matching using Sentence-BERT embeddings and cosine similarity
- **Feedback Loop** — Dislike internships with a reason (location, stipend, domain, etc.) and the system adapts future recommendations using learned constraints
- **Resume Builder** — Auto-generates an ATS-friendly resume from your profile with an inline content-editable preview; supports saving drafts
- **ATS Evaluation** — Upload a resume PDF and test it against a specific internship's requirements using a hybrid semantic + keyword scoring model
- **Profile Setup** — Comprehensive profile builder covering education, skills, projects, achievements, preferred domains, and document uploads
- **Liked Recommendations** — Save interesting internships for later review

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 20
- Python >= 3.9
- pip

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

> **Note:** Update the `file_path` in `backend/data_loader.py` to point to your local `Book2.xlsx` internship dataset.

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## How the Recommendation Engine Works

1. The user's skills, education, achievements, resume text, and certificates are combined into a single unified profile string.
2. This string is encoded into a dense vector using Sentence-BERT (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`).
3. Cosine similarity is computed against precomputed embeddings for all internships in the dataset.
4. Results are filtered against user-learned constraints (excluded locations, domains, stipend thresholds, etc.) derived from previous dislike feedback.
5. The top-N highest-scoring internships are returned.

---

## How the ATS Scorer Works

The ATS score is a weighted hybrid of two signals:

- **Semantic Score (60%)** — Cosine similarity between the resume embedding and the target internship embedding
- **Keyword Score (40%)** — Fraction of required skill tags from the internship description that appear in the resume text

```
Final Score = ((semantic_similarity × 0.6) + (keyword_match_rate × 0.4)) × 100
```

---

## Resume Enhancement Pipeline

The `ResumeEnhancer` class runs entirely offline (no external API calls) and performs:

- **Skill Categorization** — Maps flat skill lists into semantic groups (Domain Skills, Tools & Technologies, Core Concepts, etc.) using rule-based lookup with a Sentence-BERT fallback
- **Description Improvement** — Applies regex-based verb replacement and bullet point normalization
- **Summary Generation** — Auto-generates a professional summary if none exists
- **Certificate Name Extraction** — Extracts clean course names from raw PDF text using pattern matching

---

## Environment Notes

- The backend serves uploaded files as static assets from the `/uploads` directory on `http://localhost:8000/uploads/`.
- User sessions are managed via `localStorage` (`user_id` key) on the frontend — no JWT or cookie-based auth.
- The feedback constraint store is in-memory and resets on server restart. For production use, persist `feedback_store` to the database.
